## Project Structure

```
root/
├── assets/
├── README.md
└── index.html
```

- `assets/`: for storing assets such as images used in slides
- `template.html/`: boilerplate revealjs presentation for starting a brand new project.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

There is no prerequisites, the only this needed `git` for being able to clone the project.

### Getting Started

- You need to clone the project using `git`.

```
git clone git@github.com:fanto237/revealjs.git
```

## Usage

The project doesn't have any dependency, therefore it can be run using any webbrowser just by opening the `.html` and the presentation can start.

## Contributing

For contributing you need to make a copy of the `template.html` file and make your changes. I recommend using the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for having `hot reload` and therefore have the changes automatically updated on the pages.
